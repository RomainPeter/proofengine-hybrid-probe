# Vision (Public Brief)

We design for audit-first AI: separate the stochastic (LLM) from deterministic control (orchestrator) and verification (formal engine). Each step emits a PCAP with obligations, context hash, and proofs. The verifier executes proofs and issues an attestation.

This brief shows a neutral, minimal slice over code compliance.
